This project conducts an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on over 180,000 global terrorist incidents recorded between 1970 and 2017.

It utilizes the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) and Kaggle datasets to systematically identify conflict patterns and historical trends.

The technical implementation relies on Python, using Pandas and NumPy for extensive data cleaning and preprocessing of raw files.

Time-series visualizations are generated to track the fluctuation of attack frequencies and casualty rates across different decades.

Interactive geospatial heatmaps are built to visually pinpoint high-risk regions and terror hotspots on a world map.

The analysis categorizes data by attack methods (e.g., bombings, hijackings) and target types to find statistical correlations.

It examines the operational intensity of specific terrorist groups, distinguishing between claimed attacks and unknown perpetrators.

The final output transforms unstructured sociopolitical data into structured visual insights, demonstrating the evolution of global violence.
